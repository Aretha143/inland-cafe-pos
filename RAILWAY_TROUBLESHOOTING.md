# 🚀 Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ **Fixed Issues**

### **Issue 1: Build Memory Error (Exit Code 137)**
**Problem**: Railway deployment failed with exit code 137 during `npm ci`
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Added `.railwayignore` to reduce build size
- ✅ Optimized `railway.json` configuration
- ✅ Added `railway.toml` for better compatibility
- ✅ Updated build command to use `npm install` instead of `npm ci`

## 🔧 **Current Configuration**

### **railway.json**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health"
  }
}
```

### **railway.toml**
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
```

## 📋 **Next Steps for Railway**

### **Step 1: Redeploy**
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" or wait for auto-deploy

### **Step 2: Check Build Logs**
If it still fails, check the build logs for specific errors.

### **Step 3: Environment Variables**
Make sure these are set in Railway:
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- `PORT` = `3000`
- `JWT_SECRET` = `inland-cafe-pos-secret-2024`

## 🆘 **Alternative Solutions**

### **Option A: Use Render (Alternative Platform)**
If Railway continues to fail:
1. Go to https://render.com/
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
4. Connect your repository
5. Deploy

### **Option B: Use Railway CLI**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy from local
railway up
```

### **Option C: Use Docker**
If needed, we can create a Docker deployment:
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t inland-cafe-pos .

# Run locally
docker run -p 3000:3000 inland-cafe-pos
```

## 🔍 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Build Fails**
- **Cause**: Memory constraints or dependency issues
- **Solution**: Use `.railwayignore` and optimize build process

### **App Won't Start**
- **Cause**: Missing environment variables or port issues
- **Solution**: Set `NODE_ENV=production` and `PORT=3000`

### **Database Issues**
- **Cause**: SQLite file not found
- **Solution**: Database will be created automatically on first run

### **Health Check Fails**
- **Cause**: App not responding on health check path
- **Solution**: Verify `/api/health` endpoint works

## 📊 **Expected Build Process**

1. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Build Application**: `npm run build`
3. **Start Server**: `npm start`
4. **Health Check**: `/api/health`

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Health check passes
- ✅ App responds on the domain
- ✅ Login page loads correctly
