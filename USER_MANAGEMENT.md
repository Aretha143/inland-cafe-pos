## User Interface

## API Endpoints

All endpoints require admin authentication via JWT token.

- Body: `{ username, email, password, full_name, role? }`
- Returns: Created user object

## Database Schema

The system uses the existing `users` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    role TEXT DEFAULT 'cashier', -- admin, manager, cashier
    full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
    last_login DATETIME,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Default Users

The system comes with pre-seeded users:

### Admin User
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin123
- **Email**: admin@inlandcafe.com
- **Role**: Admin

### Cashier User
- **Username**: cashier
- **Password**: cashier123
- **Email**: cashier@inlandcafe.com
- **Role**: Cashier

## Security Considerations

### Password Security
- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- Minimum password length of 6 characters
- Passwords are never stored or transmitted in plain text

### Access Control
- Only admin users can access user management features
- Users cannot modify their own critical settings (prevent lockout)
- Last admin user cannot be deleted (prevent system lockout)

### Audit Trail
- User creation and modification times are tracked
- Last login times are recorded
- All user management actions are logged to console
